The "CallerInfo API" project, built using Django Rest Framework, provides a robust backend service for identifying spam numbers and retrieving names associated with phone numbers. 
Designed to be consumed by a mobile app, this API supports efficient querying and data retrieval operations. 
It can handle large volumes of data and numerous concurrent requests, ensuring quick and reliable responses. 
The use of a relational database with an ORM ensures data integrity and ease of management, while Djangoâ€™s scalability features allow the API to grow seamlessly with increased demand, making it suitable for large-scale deployment.
